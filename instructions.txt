in config, pretty simple
api_id and api_hash go to https://my.telegram.org/
log in and then go to API development tools
its pretty straight forward what you need to do after that as it will show all info 
the interval will just be the delay between it sends messages to the groups!
now...
for the groups enter in the channel link 
an example of this is for https://t.me/merkzadvertise you would put t.me/merkzadvertise
do this for all of the groups
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
put message in the config, its in json format, look up on google if you don't know what that means!

theres now only 1 more thing to do!
once you run it will ask for your phone number, it will send code and then just input the code that gets sent!

after that your all good to go!
enjoy! 

If you see people selling this please tell them about this 
were trying to get rid of these broke people tryna sell something thats easy to make!
